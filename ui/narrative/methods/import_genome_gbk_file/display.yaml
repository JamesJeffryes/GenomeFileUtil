parameters :
    gbkFile :
        ui-name : |
            GenBank file
        short-hint : |
            File with genome sequence in GenBank format or zip-file with GenBank files.
        long-hint  : |
            File with genome sequence in GenBank format or zip-file with GenBank files.

    outputObject :
        ui-name : |
            Name of the genome
        short-hint : |
            Provide a name for the genome you are uploading (for example, Shewanella_MR_4)
        long-hint  : |
            Provide a name for the genome you are uploading (for example, Shewanella_MR_4)

    source :
        ui-name : |
            Source of the GenBank file
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for the source of the data (If Ensembl the "gene" feature types will use the "gene" field as the id, otherwise the "locus_tag" field is used.)
        long-hint : |
            Provide name for the source of the data (If Ensembl the "gene" feature types will use the "gene" field as the id, otherwise the "locus_tag" field is used.)

    release :
        ui-name : |
            Release or Version of the source data
        short-hint : |
            Release or Version of the source data (for example: Release31, V4)
        long-hint : |
            Release or Version of the source data (for example: Release31, V4)

    genetic_code :
        ui-name : |
            Genetic code for the organism
        short-hint : |
            Valid genetic code (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi)
        long-hint : |
            Valid genetic code integer for translation purposes(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi)

    generate_ids_if_needed :
        ui-name : |
            Generate feature ids if needed
        short-hint : |
            Generate feature ids if the fields normally used are not present
        long-hint : |
            Generate feature ids if the fields normally used are not present. 
            For gene features the locus_tag field is used (except for Ensmebl source, then gene field is used).
            For CDS features the protein_id field is used.
            Autogenerated ids will have the format of gene_1 or CDS_3 

    exclude_ontologies :
        ui-name : |
            Exclude ontologies
        short-hint : |
            Do not include ontologies in the Genome object. This saves space.
        long-hint : |
            Do not include ontologies in the Genome object. There is a 1GB size limit.
            Ontologies tend to take up quite a bit of space.  If you have a large genome
            or do not care about ontologies you should consider excluding ontologies, assuming the source file had them.
